##Tips
1.  Envision the graph that you want to make before starting - draw a demo chart.  Make note of any variables over which you want to facet, and which variables you need to include in the analysis.  Also identify which variables are continuous and which are categorical so that you can call the correct functions to asthetics in ggplot.
2.  Usually your data are not in the right "long" format for ggplot2 - use packages like reshape and plyr to format your data.  From your demo chart, make note of the anchoring variable (that is consistent across different treatments/categories,etc)
3.  Use qplot or ggplot for calling ggplot2, geom for determining the type of plot needed, and aes for linking visual aesthetics to the data.
